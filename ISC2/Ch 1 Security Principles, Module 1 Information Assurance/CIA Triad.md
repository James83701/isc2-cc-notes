Confidentiality - balance between permitting authorized access to information, while also protecting information from improper disclosure

Information will have a certain level of sensitivity, which is how important the information is and how confidential it should remain

Integrity - the property of information whereby it is recorded, used and maintained in a way that ensures its completeness, accuracy, internal consistency and usefulness for a stated purpose

**Data integrity** is the assurance that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner.

**System integrity** refers to the maintenance of a known good configuration and expected operational function as the system processes the information. Ensuring integrity begins with an awareness of state, which is the current condition of the system. Specifically, this awareness concerns the ability to document and understand the state of data or a system at a certain point, creating a **baseline**. For example, a baseline can refer to the current state of the information—whether it is protected. Then, to preserve that state, the information must always continue to be protected through a transaction.

Availability - systems and data are accessible at the time users need them
